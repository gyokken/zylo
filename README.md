# Zylo - Branding & Marketing Agency
Landing Page Mock up

## ðŸ«§ Description

This project is a **modern branding and marketing agency website** built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The website includes interactive features like form validation, statistics counters and scroll-based animations. The main goal was to create a **user-friendly and interactive** site.

## ðŸ«§ What I Worked On

- **UI/UX Design in Figma**: I designed the website layout and UI in **Figma**, creating wireframes, prototypes and the final design.
- **Form Validation**: I created forms with proper validation to handle contact and newsletter submissions. The forms ensure that all fields are filled and that email addresses are valid before submission.
- **Scroll-based Animations**: I implemented the **IntersectionObserver** API to animate sections when they appear in the viewport and update the URL hash based on the visible section.
- **Stats Counter**: Designed a dynamic counter that animates and counts up to a target number when the user scrolls to that section.
- **Burger Menu**: Developed a responsive **burger menu** to make sure the navigation functions on smaller screens, especially mobile.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured that the website is fully responsive, including proper layout adjustments for different screen sizes.

## ðŸ«§ What I Learned

- **JavaScript IntersectionObserver API**: I learned how to create smooth animations that are triggered when a user scrolls through the page. This API is very efficient for performance.
- **Form Validation**: Gained hands-on experience with form validation to ensure a smooth, user-friendly experience when users fill out contact or newsletter forms.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: I practiced working with **requestAnimationFrame** for smooth animations and learned how to break down tasks into smaller steps to improve performance.
- **Flexbox & Grid Layouts**: I extensively used **Flexbox** and **Grid** to create flexible and modern layouts that adapt across different devices.

## ðŸ«§ Tech Stack

- **Figma**: For UI/UX design and prototyping.
- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including modern layout techniques like **Flexbox** and **Grid**.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing dynamic features such as form validation, scroll animations, and statistics counters.
- **IntersectionObserver**: For triggering animations when sections come into view during scrolling.
- **requestAnimationFrame**: For smoother animations and counters.

## ðŸ«§ Technologies and Techniques Used

- **DOM Manipulation**: For dynamically modifying and interacting with HTML elements.
- **Event Listeners**: For handling user interactions, such as form submissions and menu toggles.
- **Regular Expressions**: For validating email addresses.
- **Responsive Design**: Using **media queries**, **Flexbox** and **Grid** to ensure the site works well across various screen sizes.
- **Git & GitHub**: Used for version control and to store the project on GitHub.

## ðŸ«§ Future Improvements

- **Express.js Server**: I am currently working on integrating an **Express.js server** with **Node.js** to handle server-side logic and process user data more securely.
- **MongoDB Integration**: The plan is to connect the server to a **MongoDB cluster** for managing and storing user data, such as form submissions and other interactions.
- **Security Enhancements**: I will implement security measures to protect the application from common vulnerabilities like **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** and **NoSQL Injection**. This includes sanitizing inputs and using **Helmet.js** for HTTP headers.
- **Better Form Feedback**: Add inline error messages to improve form usability and provide a more intuitive experience.
- **Email Validation Improvements**: Enhance email validation to cover more edge cases and ensure robust form validation.
- **Admin Panel**: I am planning to build an **admin panel** so I can dynamically replace and manage media content on the website, making it easier to update without directly hardcoding content. This will allow for more flexibility and ease of content management.
- **Additional Animations**: I plan to implement animations for other sections of the website and improve the overall interactivity of the site.
